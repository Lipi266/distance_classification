# __Distance-Based Classification MLPR Lab-5__

### __MY FINDINGS:__
In this lab assignment I had to implement distance based classification using distance metrics. It gave me the opportunity to explore different tools like Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kaggle, and Weights & Biases (WandB) which are commonly used for Machine Learning projects.
It was a great experience exploring these tools, as they important for real-world workflows of machine learning and AI. This assignment allowed me to explore how to set up github workflows, user docker, logging results and output images into WandB, and automate notebook execution using github actions.
